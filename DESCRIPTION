Description: Linprot rovides a modular pipeline that allows for that seamless training and 
    evaluation of linear models for protein function prediction from user provided 
    labelled AA sequences. This package provides visualizations of the patterns 
    learned by the linear models which can be used to generate novel proteins with 
    customizable functional characteristics.
