#' Channel Rhodopsins and Their Peak Absorbation Values.
#'
#' The peak absorbation frequencies for a number of channel rhodopsins were
#' provided by (Karasuyama et al., 2018). We can treat these data as a set of
#' examples and thier respectives labels. This dataset was produced by aligning
#' the amino acid sequences of these proteins (using CLUSTAL OMEGA).
#'
#' This dataset can be substituted for any list of aligned protein sequences and
#' float values representing some functional property of those proteins.
